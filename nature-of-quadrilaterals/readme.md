You have to print the nature of the quadrilaterals whose verticesâ€™ coordinates are given.
The quadrilateral nature can be:
* nothing, in which case you should write "quadrilateral",
* parallelogram (opposite sides are parallel to each other),
* rhombus (all four sides are equal),
* rectangle (all four angles are right) or
* square (it is a rectangle and a rhombus).
